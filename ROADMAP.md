# Roadmap

P2P Framework development roadmap and future plans.

## Phase 1: Foundation âœ… COMPLETE

### Core Architecture
- [x] Modular agent with task-specific files
- [x] Token-efficient design (load only needed tasks)
- [x] Auto-setup for new repositories
- [x] Tech stack detection and command mapping
- [x] Transient context file system
- [x] Open source ready (generic examples)

### Workflows
- [x] Repository setup automation
- [x] Test-driven development loop
- [x] Context preservation across sessions
- [x] PR generation with structured descriptions

## Phase 2: Automation Hardening

### Integration & Automation
- [ ] **Ticket system integration** - Auto-fetch from Linear, JIRA, GitHub Issues instead of manual copy-paste
- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks automation** - Framework installs linters, formatters, tests automatically
- [ ] **Quality gates** - Set up CI/CD checks that prevent broken PRs
- [ ] **Self-improving automation** - Framework learns to reduce manual intervention over time

### Workflow Enhancements  
- [ ] **Deterministic feedback loops** - More automated verification steps
- [ ] **Pattern learning** - Extract and reuse successful implementation patterns
- [ ] **Error recovery** - Better handling of build failures, test errors, etc.

## Phase 3: AI CLI Agnostic

### Multi-AI Support
- [ ] **Provider abstraction** - Common interface regardless of underlying AI
- [ ] **Gemini integration** - Support for Google's Gemini models
- [ ] **GPT-4 integration** - Support for OpenAI models
- [ ] **Local model support** - Work with Ollama, etc.

### AI Orchestration
- [ ] **Specialized AI roles** - Different AIs for different tasks (one for tests, one for implementation)
- [ ] **AI collaboration** - Multiple AIs working together on complex tickets
- [ ] **Model selection** - Choose best AI for each type of task

## Phase 4: Enterprise Features

### Advanced Integrations
- [ ] **Webhook triggers** - JIRA/Linear tickets automatically start P2P workflows
- [ ] **Team collaboration** - Multiple developers working on same P2P context
- [ ] **Metrics collection** - Track P2P success rates and automation progression
- [ ] **Custom workflows** - Organization-specific P2P patterns

### Scaling
- [ ] **Multi-repository tickets** - Work across multiple repos in single workflow
- [ ] **Parallel execution** - Handle multiple tickets simultaneously
- [ ] **Advanced context management** - Better conflict resolution and merging

## Long-term Vision

### Industry Adoption
- [ ] **Framework ecosystem** - Community-contributed task modules
- [ ] **Integration marketplace** - Pre-built integrations for popular tools
- [ ] **Pattern library** - Reusable implementation patterns across tech stacks
- [ ] **Training materials** - Documentation and tutorials for new users

### Research Areas
- [ ] **AI reasoning improvement** - Better test failure analysis and fix suggestions
- [ ] **Code generation optimization** - More accurate implementation from requirements
- [ ] **Context understanding** - Better interpretation of acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Architecture guidance** - AI that suggests better system design patterns
